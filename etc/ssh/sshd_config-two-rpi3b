#	   first draft of sshd_config standards 
###	
#       Specifies the port number that sshd(8) listens on
Port 12323
# Use these options to restrict which interfaces/protocols sshd will bind to
#ListenAddress ::
#ListenAddress 0.0.0.0
# %	 Security vulnerabilities discovered with protocol 1
Protocol 2
# HostKeys for protocol version 2
# %	Commented the following line because many agree it is to weak and can be mathematically broken
#	HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key
# %	Commented the following line because supports NIST curves and according to studies those curves are suspicious for NSA backdoors
#	HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key
# %	Added the following line because strongest mathematically (and also fastest), but not widely supported
HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key
# %	Commented the following line because it is the best if you can't use Ed25519
#	HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key

#	Added the following line because it specifies the host key algorithms
HostKeyAlgorithms ssh-ed25519-cert-v01@openssh.com,ssh-ed25519

# %	Privilege Separation splits up server processes to prevent privilege escalation
UsePrivilegeSeparation yes

# Lifetime and size of ephemeral version 1 server key
KeyRegenerationInterval 3600
ServerKeyBits 1024

# Logging
SyslogFacility AUTH
LogLevel INFO

# Authentication:
# %	Changed from 120 to 60
LoginGraceTime 40
# %	Changed from prohibit-password to forced-commands-only
# >>>	need to understand this more because this supports remote backups but adds security risk
PermitRootLogin forced-commands-only

# %s	This with PasswordAuthentication 'no' are the most important security enhancements
PubkeyAuthentication yes

RSAAuthentication yes
StrictModes yes

# %	Multiple files are support with space between each;  Additional locations will support users with encrypted home directories because ssh is unable to read  user encrypted home directory until after user logged in
AuthorizedKeysFile %h/.ssh/authorized_keys /etc/ssh/keys/%u/.ssh/authorized_keys

# Don't read the user's ~/.rhosts and ~/.shosts files
IgnoreRhosts yes
# For this to work you will also need host keys in /etc/ssh_known_hosts
RhostsRSAAuthentication no
# similar for protocol version 2
HostbasedAuthentication no
# Uncomment if you don't trust ~/.ssh/known_hosts for RhostsRSAAuthentication
#IgnoreUserKnownHosts yes

# To enable empty passwords, change to yes (NOT RECOMMENDED)
PermitEmptyPasswords no

# Change to yes to enable challenge-response passwords (beware issues with
# some PAM modules and threads)
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no

# Change to no to disable tunnelled clear text passwords
#PasswordAuthentication yes

# Kerberos options
#KerberosAuthentication no
#KerberosGetAFSToken no
#KerberosOrLocalPasswd yes
#KerberosTicketCleanup yes

# GSSAPI options
#GSSAPIAuthentication no
#GSSAPICleanupCredentials yes

# %   Change the following line from yes to no
X11Forwarding no
X11DisplayOffset 10
# %   Change the following line from no back to yes (default yes other than ubuntu)
PrintMotd yes
PrintLastLog yes

# %   Changed the following line from yes to no because messages are unencrypted and spoofable
TCPKeepAlive no
#UseLogin no

#MaxStartups 10:30:60
Banner /etc/issue.net

# Allow client to pass locale environment variables
AcceptEnv LANG LC_*

Subsystem sftp /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server

# Set this to 'yes' to enable PAM authentication, account processing,
# and session processing. If this is enabled, PAM authentication will
# be allowed through the ChallengeResponseAuthentication and
# PasswordAuthentication.  Depending on your PAM configuration,
# PAM authentication via ChallengeResponseAuthentication may bypass
# the setting of "PermitRootLogin without-password".
# If you just want the PAM account and session checks to run without
# PAM authentication, then enable this but set PasswordAuthentication
# and ChallengeResponseAuthentication to 'no'.
UsePAM yes
#
###
# %	Added the following lineS     <<<
#	After 15 seconds sshd will send a message to the client expecting a response (ClientAliveInterval * ClientAliveCountMax)
ClientAliveInterval 15
ClientAliveCountMax 3

#       “no” to prevent all TCP forwarding
AllowTcpForwarding no

#       login is allowed only for user names that match one of the patterns (examples: user user@host1 *@host1)

# user-files  [![Stable Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/Release-3.227-blue.svg)](https://github.com/BradleyA/user-files/releases/tag/3.227)    [![GitHub commits](https://img.shields.io/github/commits-since/BradleyA/user-files/3.227.svg)](https://github.com/BradleyA/user-files/commits/)
General user files, dot files, with a few special tweeks to make my system time better.  When setting up a new system, I pull these files to update my user profiles.

**template directory**, there are a few template files (sh,py) that include **production standards** that I designed as best practices when creating new scripts.  When creating a new script I merge sections of code needed from a template file.  Some of the production standards are --help, DEBUG, log format, shellcheck, Documentation Language, Copyright, Architecture tree, Default variable value, --usage, and Parse CLI options and arguments.  When a production standard is changed it's verson number is updated with the git tag version number.  This allows scripts in development, test, and production to be maintianed with the latest production standard verson.

**hooks directory**, there are two GitHub commit hooks that support running of **test cases**.  The pre-commit GitHub hook bash script creates a list of commited files with repository subdirectory.  The post-commit GitHub hook bash script runs found FVT test case(s) for a commited file.  The hooks directory was created because I wanted to modify the github hooks and track changes per repository.  [Learn more about how to setup test cases.](hooks/README.md)

## Clone

To clone, change directory to the location you want to download the scripts (example: cd ~/github).  Use git to pull or clone these files into the directory. If you do not have Git then enter; "sudo apt-get install git". On the GitHub page of this script use the "HTTPS clone URL" with the 'git clone' command.

    git clone https://github.com/BradleyA/user-files.git
    cd user-files/hooks
    ln -s ../../hooks/post-commit ../.git/hooks/post-commit
    ln -s ../../hooks/pre-commit ../.git/hooks/pre-commit

## Install a File

To download the latest commit of one of these files, for example .gitignore, change to the location you want to download.  If in sub-directory on Github include the directory; example   FILEX=bin/term-layout.sh

    FILEX=.gitignore
    curl -L https://api.github.com/repos/BradleyA/user-files/tarball | tar -xzf - --wildcards BradleyA-user-files-*/$FILEX ; mv BradleyA-user-files-*/$FILEX . ; rm -r BradleyA-user-files-*/

## Setup Test Cases

    git clone https://github.com/BradleyA/user-files.git
    cd user-files/hooks
    ln -s ../../hooks/post-commit ../.git/hooks/post-commit
    ln -s ../../hooks/pre-commit ../.git/hooks/pre-commit
    cd ..
    mkdir TEST/<FILE_TO_BE_TESTED>/
    cd TEST/<FILE_TO_BE_TESTED>/

Create a test case in directory, TEST/<file_to_be_tested>/, and name the file 'FVT-<test-case-name-no-dot-001>' (example: FVT-option-help-001).  Place the expected results from the test case into a file with the same name but add '.expcted' ('dot'expected).  In your test case, pipe the output into a file with the same name but add '.out'.  Append the following lines into your test case:

    #
    diff "${0}".expected "${0}".out >/dev/null 2>&1
    RETURN_CODE=${?}
    if [ ${RETURN_CODE} -eq 0 ] ; then
           echo "${BOLD}Test case --->${NORMAL} ${0} ${1} ${RETURN_CODE} - No difference with expected output - ${BOLD}PASS - PASS${NORMAL}"
    elif [ ${RETURN_CODE} -eq 1 ] ; then
           echo "${BOLD}Test case --->${NORMAL} ${0} ${1} ${RETURN_CODE} - Differences with expected output - ${BOLD}FAIL - FAIL${NORMAL}"
           diff -y "${0}".expected "${0}".out
    else
           echo "${BOLD}Test case --->${NORMAL} ${0} ${1} ${RETURN_CODE} - Test script ERROR - ${BOLD}FAIL - FAIL${NORMAL}"
    fi
